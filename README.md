## Hi! Iâ€™m Caio Ferreira,

Here's a little more about me:

1. I current work as a Web Developer at [Financial Cents](https://financial-cents.com/).
2. With 5 years of experience on the WordPress field, and 4 with development. Before starting WordPress, I worked with a few other CMS on the market such as HubSpot, Joomla, AEM and others.
3. In my opinion, websites should always be users, and SEO-centric.
4. I make part of the [Belo Horizonte WordPress Community](https://www.meetup.com/wordpressbelohorizonte/) and shared a little on how WordPress helped shaping my career at [HeroPress](https://heropress.com/essays/how-wordpress-changed-my-life-gratitude/).
5. I love learning new languages and getting to know people from different cultures.
6. Entrepreneurship and Education are my passion, I really believe we can change the world through Education!
7. I really enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and running. If I could, I would climb the mountains of Minas Gerais in Brazil every day.
