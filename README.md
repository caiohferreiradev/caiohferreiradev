## Hi! I’m Caio Ferreira,

Here's a little more about me:

1. I current work as a Web Developer at [Financial Cents](https://financial-cents.com/).
2. I have 5 years of experience working with WordPress and 4 years in web development overall. Before focusing on WordPress, I worked with other CMS platforms such as HubSpot, Webflow, Drupal, AEM, and others.
3. In my opinion, websites should always be user-centric, balancing performance, accessibility, and maintainability.
4. I run the [Belo Horizonte local WordPress Community](https://www.meetup.com/wordpressbelohorizonte/) (https://wpbh.com.br/) and shared a bit about how WordPress helped shape my career on [HeroPress](https://heropress.com/essays/how-wordpress-changed-my-life-gratitude/).
5. I love learning new languages and getting to know people from different cultures.
6. Entrepreneurship and education are my passions. I truly believe we can change the world through education.
7. I really enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and running. If I could, I would climb the mountains of Minas Gerais, Brazil, every day.
